        <h4>1.What are the advantages of Bootstrap?</h4>
        <p><strong>Ans => </strong>Bootstrap is open-source, making it an accessible choice for developers aiming to
            create responsive and visually appealing websites.</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bootstrap’s ready-made components accelerate development, enabling faster project completion.</li>
            <li>The built-in grid system ensures websites adapt seamlessly to diverse screen sizes and devices.</li>
            <li>Bootstrap maintains a uniform look and feel across various elements, ensuring a cohesive user
                experience.</li>
            <li>Bootstrap handles browser differences, minimizing the need for extensive testing and ensuring a
                consistent user experience.</li>
            <li>Customizable themes, variables, and mixins provide flexibility to match specific project requirements
                and branding.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>2.What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h4>
        <p><strong>Ans => </strong>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using
            our default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) <br>center the content within
            them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>

        <h4>3.What are the default Bootstrap text settings?</h4>
        <p><strong>Ans => </strong>Use a native font stack that selects the best font-family for each OS and device.
            For a more inclusive and accessible type scale, we use the browser’s default root <br>font-size (typically
            16px)
            so visitors can customize their browser defaults as needed.</p>

        <h4>4.What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h4>
        <p><strong>Ans => </strong>Bootstrap Grid System allows up to 12 columns across the page. You can use each of
            them individually or merge them together for wider columns. You can use all <br> combinations of values
            summing
            up to 12. You can use 12 columns each of width 1, or use 4 columns each of width 3 or any other combination.
